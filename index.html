            <p>
                Due to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020,
                many companies have implemented remote work or hybrid work
                models. However, as the situation improves, numerous positions
                have gradually transitioned back to on-site work starting from
                2022.
                <br>
                <br>
                From 2020 to 2022, the percentage of remote positions are all
                above 50% and higher than the percentage of on-site positions,
                indicating that remote work was still the mainstream in the
                industry. However, from 2023 onward, the percentage of remote
                positions becomes (35.35%), which is lower than the percentage
                of on-site positions (63.29%), indicating that the industry is
                gradually returning to on-site work. Data Science job seekers
                should be aware of this trend and be prepared to work on-site.
